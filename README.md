# Refactoring Your Developer Identity

This repository contains the slide deck and related resources for the "Refactoring Your Developer Identity" talk by Chris Ayers. The session focuses on helping senior engineers and technical leaders decouple their professional value from any single language or framework and re‑anchor it in durable, transferable skills.

## Overview

The talk covers:

- Identity smells and anti‑patterns
- Costs of stack-locked thinking (personal & organizational)
- Transferable skill inventory & mapping exercises
- New stack adoption loop & learning debt log
- Decision frameworks (Build / Buy / Learn, Mini ADR)
- Risk vectors: platform shifts, automation, AI commoditization
- Action plans (30 / 60–90 day) & accountability systems

## Resources

Reference materials and concepts mentioned:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADR pattern)
- Lightweight decision log / mini ADR
- Learning debt log (unknown → hypothesis → resolution)
- Cognitive bias references (confirmation, sunk cost, status quo)
- System / outcome framing questions (metrics, cost of delay, risk radius)
